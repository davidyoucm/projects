            If these are some of the problems that you encounter at work or in
            school, then this post is for
            <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><b>you</b></span
            >. As you might already know, Japan is so advanced in its technology
            that its products always never fail to beat those of its
            counterparts. Today, I'll be sharing about a some of the eyedrops
            that I purchased. I bought these eyedrops during my trip to Japan.
            During that trip, I had purchased quite a lot of beauty, skincare
            and health products. This eyedrop was recommended to me by my mother
            (who gave me a to-buy list), and is also highly raved on several
            online platforms!. If you are travelling to Japan and you are
            thinking of what kind of eyedrop to purchase, I would highly
            recommend these eyedrops to you!
          </p>

            In the age of advanced information technology there is an increasing
            number of environments in which the eyes can become overworked. Such
            environments lead to declined focus-adjustment function and tired
            eyes (eye fatigue), manifesting as a heavy feeling in the back of
            the eyes. Sante Medical 12 is an eye drop for treating eye fatigue
            that contains a precise balance of twelve active ingredients, four
            of which are at the maximum concentrations,* including vitamin B12
            and neostigmine methyl sulfate, which are effective for eye fatigue.
            Sante Medical 12 improves declined focus-adjustment function by
            working on the muscles and parasympathetic nerves responsible for
            adjusting focus, moisturizes dry eyes, and facilitates tissue
            metabolism by supplying nutrients to the eyes. This product supports
            a “healthy eye” life for people suffering eye strain due to the
            demands of modern society. Dosage: Instill 1 to 3 drops at a time, 5
            to 6 times daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overall, I personally feel that this eyedrop is effective in
            relieving eye fatigue when there is too much stress is placed on the
            eyes. By facilitating tissue metabolism in tired eyes, it provides
            effective relief from symptoms such as tired eyes and red eyes. In
            addition, these eye drops cause a strong refreshing and invigorating
            sensation to spread from the surface of the eyes. If you want to
            refresh your eyes, this product will certainly meet you need!
            However, one must take note that the minty, burning feeling does
            take some time to get used to.
