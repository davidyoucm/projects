               When you’ve got a limited budget, the last thing you want to do it spend all your money on unnecessary products. This August, we have collated a list of products that we deem are the best of 2020 (as of now at least!).
             </p>

             <h3 align="left">
               1. Laneige Water Sleeping Mask Skin 
             </h3>
             <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/406f9e96-7795-41db-8544-d5bc086e2985%2FUntitled_Artwork%207.png?v=1598506863416" alt="Laneige Water Sleeping Mask Skin" class = "center">
             <p>
              The sleeping mask is not tacky or sticky at all and I think it will be a great product for all skin types – even oily and acne-prone. Laneige Water Sleeping Mask has been formulated with Hydro Ionized Mineral Water in a high concentration to deliver intense moisture to even the most parched and stressed skin 
             </p>

               2. Lululun Hydrating Mask
             </h3>
             <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/406f9e96-7795-41db-8544-d5bc086e2985%2FUntitled_Artwork%206.png?v=1598506868591" alt="Lululun Hydrating Mask" class = "center">
             <p>
               These masks are well saturated but not as much as an individual packaged sheet mask. I find this to be very reasonable and sensible because most people don't keep a sheet mask on for more than hour or so. In fact, I always felt guilty not wearing my sheet masks for more than an hour because it feels like such a waste of product! This pack of sheet masks really has very minimal waste. I actually like that they aren't too saturated because they don't feel like they're moving and slipping off your face and you don't have serum dripping from your face. Although it isn't as saturated, it still has a ton of product and will last you more than hour of wear time. I find it starts drying up a bit, just after the hour. This is fine with me because I usually get sick of wearing my sheet mask by then. </p>
             <p>
               Even after I remove the mask, the serum is still doing a lot of work. After an hour of masking, I immediately feel my skin is tighter and much more plump. It is also extremely hydrated and feels very fresh. I usually mask right before bed, so after removing the mask, I apply a light oil to my face and go to sleep. In the morning, my skin is GLOWING, it feels so plump, and actually feels tighter! I have never had that feeling before with other sheet masks. My skin has a beautiful youthful elasticity and bounce to it. My skin just feel super soft and smooth after using and going to bed. I feel like my body has soaked up all the nutrients and really used it to repair and refresh my skin! I am so pleased with the results especially for such a cheap and inexpensive face mask! I wasn't expecting such a high level of quality! I wish I had discovered these before!

               3. Simple Pore Scrub Cleanser
             </h3>
             <img src="https://cdn.glitch.com/406f9e96-7795-41db-8544-d5bc086e2985%2FUntitled_Artwork%203.png?v=1598506939657" alt="Simple Pore Scrub" class = "center">
             <p>
               The Detox Simple Clear Pure Scrub is a gentle exfoliator with a gel-like consistency. It contains tiny bamboo exfoliators to refine pores and rough, uneven patches. Having tried the Detox Simple Clear Pore Scrub firsthand, I noticed that my skin instantly felt brighter, clearer, and less oily. Personally, I think it is effective in doing exactly what it was made to do - it successfully cleanses skin deep down to help eliminate pore-clogging dirt, oil and make-up to leave the skin purified. Additionally, my skin usually gets irritated and feels painful when I apply exfoliators due to its dryness. This product, on the other hand, was not harsh on the skin and I did not experience any form of discomfort. 
             </p>
             <p>
               I genuinely enjoyed using this product - in fact, I personally feel that this pure scrub is definitely perfect for people with oily skin! However, people with dry skin should be mindful of the number of times they use this product in a week as it may accentuate their dry skin if they overuse it.

               4. Fresh Strawberry Exfoliating Face Wash

             <p>
               Even though it is daily gentle exfoliating face wash, i usually use it 2-3 times a week. It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth!! It is really affordable and smells like strawberry jam, definitely would recommend! Fresh Sugar Strawberry Exfoliating Face Wash is a beautiful, exfoliating cleanser after a long, hot day.
