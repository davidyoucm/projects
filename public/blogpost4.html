          <p>
            Hello guys!!! Today I’ve an amazing product to share with you
            guys!!! So recently, I spotted an Instagram post featuring
            <a href="http://0.8liter.com">0.8L</a>. Seeing that 0.8L allows
            users to try and review products from all over the world for free, I
            decided to give it a shot! The TRY FREE CAMPAIGN by 0.8L allows
            users to try products for free (note that users are selected on a
            random basis). All you have to do is share the reviews/campaigns on
            your social media site. 0.8L Singapore also has TRY-BUY NOW ($3.99
            being the lowest price) which starts for TRY NOW &amp; BUY NOW. The
            TRY NOW service is first come first service and when the TRY NOW
            service supplies ends, users get the chance to buy products at a
            price lower than retail price, depending on the amount of stocks
            there are. I was attracted by the very fact that they had ‘Try Free’
            for the brand 3CE! (if you don’t already know, I recently splurged
            on many 3ce products and I absolutely love 3CE!) The idea of trying
            new products and being able to share my experience with others was
            just so tempting that I signed up with 0.8L. I did not get selected
            to try the 3CE Products. Just for fun, I decided to try applying for
            other products. Boy, I was shocked! I actually got selected to
            review the IRÉN SERUM.

          <p>So what is <a href="http://irenskin.com">IRÉN</a>?</p>

          <p>
            According to Irén’s website, Irén's skincare products are created to
            fit the lifestyles of busy women. Working in synergy with a national
            research agency, Irén's unique patent formulations have gone through
            over 10,000 hours of clinical research and testing to provide time
            saving and proven results for your skin.

            />
          </p>

          <p>
            <em>I was spoilt for choice!</em> There are 7 customised serums,
            each made for different purposes - anti-aging, clearing, whitening,
            soothing, hydrating, anti-acne and anti-wrinkle. If you have other
            skin concerns, you may get the other serums :-) They cost $58 for
            10ml. As mentioned, I have extremely dry skin, especially around my
            forehead, nose and lip area. Often, my skin is flaking and whenever
            I apply make up (which is rarely ever, but sometimes), my make up
            appears patchy and uneven; I always need to apply moisturiser in
            advance. As such, I picked the <strong>hydrating serum</strong>,
            which is highly suitable for people with dehydrated and rough skin.
            Then.. it came in the mailbox with a mini greeting card (thank you
            for being so thoughtful IRÉN!) and an informative leaflet.

          <strong><em>my personal experience.&nbsp;</em></strong>

          <p>
            I was very confused on how to use the product at first because I
            failed to read the informative leaflet carefully (I was just too
            excited to try it out). As such, I had to ‘figure it out’ myself.
          </p>

          <p>
            To be frank.. the product was so cute!!!!!! It reminded me of those
            days we used test drops during Chemistry &amp; Biology classes lol.
            So anyways, apparently you just have to unscrew the lid and there’ll
            be this button thing at the top. Press it and it’ll suck the serum
            upwards, and it’ll be just enough for your face. It was advised to
            use it after their skin clear lotion, which obviously I didn’t have
            so I used it by itself. As adviced, I used 2-3 drops of serum (the
            amount you suck up once is just enough) and spread it all over my
            face. It feels rather light weight and doesn’t feel greasy at all;
            although I would say that i could still feel that I applied the
            serum on. After use, I felt that my skin appeared glowy and
            brighter. The next morning, my skin felt super moisturised and
            smooth!! :) I love how it’s possible to mix the serums together to
            customise it according to your skin needs! The only downside about
            this product is that it is pricey for its small size ($58 for 10ml).
          </p>

          <p>
            Nevertheless, I would still highly recommend this product to anyone
            and everyone! Thank you IRÉN and 0.8L SG for sending this amazing
            hydrating serum to me! ☺️ With that, till my next review x
