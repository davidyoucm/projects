              enables users to buy products at a price lower than the retail
              price. You may check out how the TRY-BUY NOW campaign works

            Recently, I've been into getting lipsticks that belong to the
            category: my-lips-but-better. In particular, a popular make up brand
            known as 3 Concept Eyes ("3CE") under the Korean fashion label
            StyleNanda, had caught my attention. I have personally bought a few
            myself from YesStyle and I found the range of lip shades offered by
            3CE particularly suitable for daily wear. Additionally, as someone
            who doesn't really put make up, I noticed that korean make up
            products tend to be more suitable for users like me who prefer light
            make up, as compared to western ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, being a sucker for 3CE products, I did not hesitate to
            get the lipstick in shade #116 (Inked Heart) when I saw that there
            was an ongoing TRY-BUY NOW Campaign for 3CE's Mood Recipe Lipstick.
            3CE's Mood Recipe Lipstick #116 belongs to the Mood Recipe
            collection. Now, let me give you an overview of the 3CE Mood Recipe
            Lip Colour Collection first.

          <p>Next, I will be sharing more about the lip product sent to me.</p>

            <b>3CE Inked Heart #116</b> is a
            <b>light brownish orange MLBB</b> shade, as you can see from the
            swatch below. This lipstick <b>retails for $34.41</b> in Sephora
            Singapore (you may also get it from YesStyle!). When applied, the
            lip colour looks really natural on me!! :) It has a creamy matte
            finish. I absolutely love how pigmented inked heart is! It is also
            comfortable on my lips.

            However, as with other lip products in the 3ce mood recipe
            collection, the downside of this product is that it’s not very
            long-lasting (not transfer proof/kiss proof, has to be re-applied
            throughout the day). When applied on dry lips, the product also
            doesn’t glide on v smoothly. Nevertheless, applying lip balm would
            do the trick!!! :-)
          </p>
          <p>
            If I were to rate this lipstick according to the following criteria:
          </p>
          <p>
            Blendability: 4.5/5.0<br />
            Staying power: 3.5/5<br />
            Colour payoff: 4.5/5
          </p>
          <!-- wp:paragraph -->

            Overall, I’m a HUGE FAN of the 3ce Mood Recipe Collection. I would
            highly recommend this product to people looking for a natural,
            unique shade that is easy to pull off!!!!!☺️ I can’t wait to get my
            hands on more ‘TRY NOW’ 3CE products keke.
