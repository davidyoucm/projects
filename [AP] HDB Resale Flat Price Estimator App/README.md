When it comes to buying and selling on the HDB resale market, a big problem is the issue of accurately estimating the fair price for resale flats. To alleviate this problem, many people visit real estate websites, use online tools or enlist property agents to assist them. However, these methods come with their fair share of issues too.

To tackle the aforementioned difficulties that buyers and sellers in the HDB resale market may face, this project involved developing an app that is able to provide fair price estimates of HDB flats in a specified HDB Town.

The app takes in a number of user-selected parameters and returns a fair price estimate along with useful information such as details on nearby amenities. This allows buyers and sellers to compare HDB flat prices at a glance, which saves a lot of time and hassle. In addition, the app also helps users find out the information they need to make an informed choice by providing numerous other visualisations and even a tool that allows them to specifically compare the information on 2 selected HDB flats.
